    <p>The social life of the adult male is very different. As he matures, a male spends more time at the edge of his group
        and associates with outside males or even other families. At Amboseli, young males spend over 80% of their time away
        from their families when they are 14â€“15. When males permanently leave, they either live alone or with other males.
